      John 5:7</a> talks about how the father, the holy spirit and the word/Jesus as in <a

       I am the first, and I am the last;
           besides Me there is no God.">Isaiah 44:6-8</a> is the father saying he is the only God and the first and the

      target="_blank">John
      14:28</a> people talk about the father being greater than jesus(the son) and trought <a

      title="4 I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work You have given Me to do. 5 And now, O Father, glorify Me in Your own presence with the glory which I had with You before the world existed."

    did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.
7 But He emptied Himself,
    taking upon Himself the form of a servant,
    and was made in the likeness of men." target="_blank">Philippians 2</a> the bible shows how jesus laid aside the
    glory of god and
    became a
    humble human.<br>
    Jesus does NOT say "god is greater than i" he says "the father is greater than i" now it makes sence, theire not the
    same, when jesus returns to the Father, he will get his glory back.</p>
  <p class="NormalText">The son(Jesus) is the only true God, The Father is the only true God and the holy spirit is the
    only true God and they are all 1 single God not 3 different ones</p>

  <p class="NormalText">The argument that Jesus prayed is also used a lot against the Trinity, now lets look into some
    of Jesus's prayers like in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+17&version=Mev"
      title=" 21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— 23 I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me."
      target="_blank">john
      17</a> Jesus prays to the Father as Jesus is not the father and as jesus left aside his glory it makes sense</p>
  <br>

  <p class="NormalText">How can Jesus be God and the son of God?</p>
  <p class="NormalText">Jesus is from the person view the son of God, but Jesus is the spirit of God in the flesh so
    Jesus the flesh is the son of God</p>

  <p class="NormalText">Jesus is the first creation?</p>

      1</a> which
    Colossians says at the beginning he is the image of the invisible God also Firstborn doesn't mean the first to be
    born, it means the hightest of the foodchain, the leader, as said in <a

      target="_blank">Exodus 4</a>.</p>
  <p class="NormalText">Jesus Never said he is god?</p>
  <p class="NormalText">Not even read the bible saying these claims, theres many verses where jesus says he IS God and
    claims the word to be his word!</p>

8 And being found in the form of a man,
    He humbled Himself
    and became obedient to death,
        even death on a cross." target="_blank">philippians 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=MEV"
        title="17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 He who believes in Him is not condemned. But he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 This is the verdict, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be revealed that his deeds have been done in God.”"
