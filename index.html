        <h1 class="mainTitle">God's intended way to live</h1>
        
        <p class="Bibletext">Romans 8:10<br>But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.</p>
        <p class="meaning">This means that you should not become attached to earthly life, and that becoming attached to God will bring you to heaven, where God will protect you from evil and save you from this evil world. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="Bibletext">John 14:30<br>I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me</p>
        <p class="meaning">Word of jesus, he ment the ruler of this world is the devil, theres other bible lines like these: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%204:1-11&version=NIV" target="_blank">matthew 4:1-11</a>.<br>You shouldn't be affraid of him tho, he already lost this war as it is written in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A7-11&version=NIV" target="_blank">John 16:7-11</a></p>
        <br>
        <p class="Bibletext">Psalm 37:13<br>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.</p>
        <p class="meaning">The devil knows he will lose this war, so nothing is lost in your life. God will always bring you out of life problems; he is far more powerful than any other being, including angels and fallen angels.<br>he greatly surpasses everything we could ever imagine as it is written in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+3%3A16-21&version=NIV" target="_blank">ephesians 3:16-21</a>.</p>

        <p class="warning">Be aware!</p>
        <p class="warningText">Some beliefs or religions are bringing you down the wrong path. Let me list some of them for you and explain why they're wrong.<br></p>
        <ul class="warningText">
            <li><strong>Catholism:</strong> Catholics believe in other humans too, like "Mary,"  going against <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2042:8&version=NIV" target="_blank">Isaiah 42:8</a>.
                <p class="bibleVerse"><strong>I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.</strong></p>
                <br>
                It's not the only offense against God they do; they also lie to make money out of the followers of this church going against 
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A11-13&version=MSG" target="_blank">Leviticus 19:11-13</a></li>
                <p><strong>Note, not all catholics are like that, but many</strong></p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>calvinism:</strong> They can be in every church and have every belief, which is wrong because they believe that God doesn't give everyone a chance to believe in him, which goes against <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:9&version=NIV" target="_blank">2 Peter 3:9</a>
                <p class="bibleVerse"><strong>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</strong></p>
            </li>
