        <p>God wants us to live in a relationship with him.</p>
        <p>He sent the Holy Spirit to us as another helper as in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A15-18&version=mev" title="The Promise of the Spirit
15 “If you love Me, keep My commandments. 16 I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Counselor, that He may be with you forever: 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, for it does not see Him, neither does it know Him. But you know Him, for He lives with you, and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you fatherless. I will come to you.">John 14:15-18</a>.</p>
        <p>It is important that we live by faith and not by sight <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:7&version=mev" title="7 For we walk by faith, not by sight.">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>.</p>
        <p>You can trust the holy spirit on your journey, he is your guide and helper.</p>
        <p>And it is important that we follow the bible and not self made images, it is important to ask ourselves if situations come from God or not.</p>
        <p>God wants us to live with God togheter in a relationship and guidance even if we go trought tribulation, we can still trust him.</p>
        <p>We are now under the new covenant and the law is written in our hearts.</p>
        <p>If you glorify the Lord, then youre doing the right thing. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206%3A12-20&version=mev" title="Glorify God in Your Body
12 “All things are lawful to me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything. 13 “Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food,” but God will destroy both of them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:12-20</a></p>
        <p>The cross Jesus carried is enought to forgive all our sins, and it will be possible if we trust him to forgive us and walk with God togheter in life, God mainly wants a relationship with you.</p>
