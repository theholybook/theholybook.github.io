    <p>King James version (KJV) does not recognise sheol/hades instead writes hell everywhere</p>
    <p>The New King James Version (NKJV), the Modern English Version (MEV) and the English Standart Version (ESV) don't
      have this issue</p>

    <p>This page might trigger some people who accepted certain creeds since it shows how Jesus did not go to hell
      during his 3 days where he was dead, preaching in hell would be useless since no one could be saved (example the
      apostle, Athanasian, ect; creeds prooven wromg by the bible)</p>
