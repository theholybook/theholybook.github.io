        <p>Living whitout God</p>
        <p>People whitout God usually live whitout purpose of life and forget we have morals.</p>

          forgive/change the choice of not wanting God in life, pharoh was an example who commited the unforgivable sin
          in the book of exodus</p>
        <p>The unforgivable sin is to know the truth/God but reject him willingly, its not an accidental sin, its a
          willfull sin, one you do on purpose, one day, your heart will be so hardened that you can NOT believe anymore,
          at one momment people will cross that line if they keep denying God willfully</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>King James version (KJV) does not recognise sheol/hades instead writes hell everywhere</p>
    <p>The New King James Version (NKJV), the Modern English Version (MEV) and the English Standart Version (ESV) don't
      have this issue</p>

    <p>This page might trigger some people who accepted certain creeds since it shows how Jesus did not go to hell
      during his 3 days where he was dead, preaching in hell would be useless since no one could be saved (example the
      apostle, Athanasian, ect; creeds prooven wromg by the bible)</p>

    <p>This is ultimatively the purpose of life, The question:<br>
      <strong>Do you prefere God or this world?</strong><br>and its your choice now, is God more worth it or are the
      pleasures of this world better?
