      <h3>Rider of conquest</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:1-2<br>1 I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals. Then I heard one of the four living
        creatures saying, with voice like thunder, “Come and see.” 2 And I looked, and there before me was a white
        horse. He who sat on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering that he might
        overcome.</p>

      <h3>Rider of War</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:3-4<br>
        3 When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come and see.” 4 Then another horse
        that was red went forth. Power was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth, causing people to
        kill one another. Then a great sword was given to him.</p>

      <p>Revelation 8:8-9<br>
        8 Then the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the
        sea. A third of the sea became blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the
        ships were destroyed.</p>

      <h3>Rider of famine</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:5-6<br>
        5 When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there was a black
        horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. 6 Then I heard a voice in the midst of the four
        living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a day’s wages, and three quarts of barley for a day’s
        wages, and do not harm the oil and the wine.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>1/3 of Water becomes bitter</h3>
      <p>Revelation 8:10-11<br>
        10 The third angel sounded, and a great star from heaven, burning like a torch, fell on a third of the rivers
        and on the springs of waters. 11 The name of this star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and
        many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>all the water on earth becomes blood</h3>
      <p>Revelation 16:4-7<br>
        4 The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 5 Then I heard
        the angel of the waters saying:

        “You are righteous, O Lord,
        who is and was and who is to be,
        because You have judged these things.
        6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,
        and You have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!”

        7 And I heard another from the altar saying:

        “Yes, Lord God Almighty,
        true and righteous are Your judgments.”</p>

      <h3>Rider of death</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:7-8<br>
        7 When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 8 So I looked,
        and there was a pale horse, and the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed him. Power over a
        fourth of the earth was given to them, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the
        earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>1/3 of all stars and planets stoped shining</h3>
      <p>Revelation 8:12<br>12 The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and
        a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day had no light, and likewise a
        third of the night.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>The sun starts scorching the earth</h3>
      <p>Revelation 16:8-9<br>
        8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and power was given to him to scorch men with fire. 9 Men
        were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues, and they
        did not repent and give Him glory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-item">5.</div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Souls crying under the altar</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:9-11<br>
        9 When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God
        and for the testimony they had held. 10 They cried out with a loud voice, “How long, O Sovereign Lord, holy and
        true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” 11 Then a white robe was given to
        each of them, and they were told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers
        should be completed, who would be killed as they were.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Modern military warfare</h3>
      <p style="line-height: 0.9;">Revelation 9:1-12<br>9 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. 6 During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.

7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. 8 Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 9 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. 10 They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months. 11 They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).

12 The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>The kingdom of satan will sufer a lot more</h3>
      <p>Revelation 16:10-11<br>10 The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was
        filled with darkness. They gnawed their tongues because of the anguish, 11 and blasphemed the God of heaven
        because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-item">6.</div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Earthquake and darkness</h3>
      <p>Revelation 6:12-14<br>
        12 I watched as He opened the sixth seal. And suddenly there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like
        sackcloth made from goat hair, and the moon became like blood. 13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as
        a fig tree drops its unripe figs when it is shaken by a strong wind. 14 Then the heavens receded like a scroll
        when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Euphrates dried up and 4 angels killing 1/3 of humanity</h3>
      <p>Revelation 9:13-15<br>
        13 The sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 14
        saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates
        River.” 15 And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to
        kill a third of mankind.
        <br><br>It also talks about an army of 200 000 000 Horsemen ready to kill everyone who does not repent
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Euphrates dries up entirely and 3 strong demons come to earth for the final battle</h3>
      <p>Revelation 16:12-14<br>
        12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and its water was dried up, to prepare the
        way for the kings from the East. 13 Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the
        dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 For they are spirits of
        demons, performing signs, who go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the
        battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-item">7.</div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Silence in Heaven</h3>
      <p>Revelation 8:1<br>
        When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>The kingdom of God declared on earth</h3>
      <p>Revelation 11:15<br>15 The seventh angel sounded, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying:

        “The kingdoms of the world have become
        the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ,
        and He shall reign forever and ever.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h3>Biggest earthquake and meteorite rain ever</h3>
      <p>Revelation16:17-21<br>17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the
        temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 18 And there were noises and thundering and lightning
        and a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake, as had never occurred since men were on the earth.
        19 The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the Great was
        remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath. 20 Every island fled
        away, and the mountains were not found. 21 Great hail, about the weight of a hundred pounds,[a] fell from heaven
        upon man. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because that plague was so severe.
