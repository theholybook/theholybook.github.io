    <h1>Religions</h1>
    <p>Starting off what the bible says about religion, <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:26-27&version=mev"
        title="26 If anyone among you seems to be religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion is vain. 27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world.">James
        1:26-27</a> tells us that if someone is religious lets him be pure in his religion and helping the poor that
      lack
      in life, if he does not follow his religious practices, its for nothing</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26%3A4-8&version=mev"
        title="4 “My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning in my own nation and at Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. 5 They knew me from the beginning and could testify, if they wished, how according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.">Acts
        26:4-8</a> talks about how pharisees were for example religious.</p>
    <p>The true meaning of religion is putting the ritualistic nature of a certain religion over what God actually
      wants.</p>
    <p>This most of all impacts rituals in religions</p>
    <p>True Christianity isn't a religion, its a relationship instead</p>

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <h4>Main difference</h4>
        <p>Religion requires steps and preparations, religion is always man made</p>
        <h4>Prayer</h4>
        <p>Religious prayer is a ritual people have to do to please thier gods/god.</p>
        <p>Religious prayer often requires steps and a certain position.</p>
        <p>Religious prayer can be often recognised by things like quickly saying a certain text or by reading a text
          for prayer</p>
        <h4>Rituals</h4>
        <p>In religion theres a concept of paying yourself to heaven idea behind it, you go to heaven by your acts not
          your belief</p>
        <p>People do rituals in hopes to please thier gods/god</p>
        <p>Even the Lords supper is seen as something different by certain churches, certain churches think they drink
          litterally the blood of Jesus and cleanse themselves trought that</p>
        <p>Religion has also one certain trait, is it following steps and instruction to do rituals, if one goal is not
          met, then the ritual was all for nothing</p>
        <h4>Motives</h4>
        <p>The motives behind religion is fear and the will to go to heaven</p>
        <p>People think that by doing good acts and by following all rules tighthly that they will go to heaven, usually
          those rules are taught by other people who twist the scripture.</p>
        <h4>In short</h4>
        <p>fear is what drives people to religion</p>
        <p>also objectifying God is what drives religion</p>
      </center>

    <div class="secondcolumn">
      <center>
        <h2>Relationship</h2>
        <h4>Main difference</h4>
        <p>Relationship is having God and the law in the heart, its accepting him in our lives and relying on him</p>
        <h4>Prayer</h4>
        <p>Relationship prayer is how people talk to God, it is sending a message.</p>
        <p>True communication with God can be done in any situation and position, it can be done with the mouth or
          trought as long as it comes from the heart</p>
        <p>Relationship prayer can be recognised if the prayer comes from the heart and is as talking to another person
        </p>
        <h4>Rituals</h4>
        <p>In relationship people will be saved trought faith not by actions. (<a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2&version=MEV"
            title="8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, 9 not of works, so that no one should boast.">Ephesians
            2</a>) faith asks for trust and love.</p>
        <p>If you have a relationship with God, you will follow the laws out of love as in <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A15-31&version=mev"
            title="15 “If you love Me, keep My commandments. ">John 14:15-31</a></p>
        <p>The Lords supper is there to remember how Jesus died for us, its not to cleanse or anything else</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A54-58&version=mev"
            title="54 Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life. And I will raise him up on the last day. 55 For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. 56 Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.">John
            6:54-58</a> is seen as symbolic and is made to be remembered and honored.</p>
        <h4>Motives</h4>
        <p>The motives behind a relationship is respect, love and trust.</p>
        <p>People who have a relationship with God, follow his word and question other peoples teachings, which is also
          what the bible tells us <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:1&version=mev"
            title="Test the Spirits
4 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.">1
            John 4:1</a></p>
        <h4>In short</h4>
        <p>respect and love is what drives relationship</p>
        <p>Believers see God as a king not a dictator</p>

      <h4>What distinctifies it</h4>
      <p>Catholics follow traditions and spiritual leaders, example: "the pope, priests, ect"</p>
      <p>Catholics believe that sanctifying, worshipping or even venerating the saints will make them closer to God</p>
      <p>Catholics usually use verses like <a
          href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A1-3&version=MEV"
          title="The Discipline of the Lord
12 Therefore, since we are encompassed with such a great cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. 2 Let us look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and your hearts give up.">hebrew
          12:1</a> and that christians do not die but sleep while dead.</p>
      <p>catholics also tend to think that thei're the first church ever and use the verse out of context <a
          href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+16%3A17-19&version=mev"
          title="17 Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”">matthew
          16:17-19</a></p>
      <p>what this
        verse trully means is that Jesus has ordered to build a church on top of the mountain in Caesarea Philippi to
        show dominance over evil, the hole on the bottom of the mountain looked horrible as like hell.</p>
      <p>This hole is also called the gates of hell</p>
      <center>
        <img src="gatesofhell.jpg" width="50%">
      </center>
      <p>Catholics also tend to worship objects like the crucifix and believe it holds power.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="protestant">
      <hr>
      <h4>What distinctifies it</h4>
      <p>Protestants stay with the bible itself and don't invent traditions or have spiritual leaders.</p>
      <p>Protestants worship God only and no one else</p>
      <p>Protestants usually are closer to the truth than catholics since </p>
      <p>Protestants also have specificly 66 books and dont include apocryphas</p>
      <p>Protestants take verses like <a
          href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A1-5&version=MEV" title="5 The living know that they will die,
but the dead know nothing;
they have no more reward,
for the memory of them is forgotten.">Ecclesiastes 9:1-5</a> to tell catholics they should not worship or venerate the
        dead</p>
      <p>Protestant use verses like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2044:6-8&version=mev"
          title="Idolatry Condemned
6 Thus says the Lord the King of Israel,
and his Redeemer the Lord of Hosts:
I am the first, and I am the last;
besides Me there is no God.">isaiah 44:6-8</a> to reject the pope or any other religious leader</p>
      <p>Usually protestant churches arn't the big and glorious looking churches but use normal churches or even just
        rooms to worship God togheter</p>
      <p>Usually a protestant preacher does not take this fancy clothes as catholic priests have and come in normal
        clothes</p>

          <strong>Docetism:</strong> Teaches that Jesus only seemed to have a physical body and did not truly suffer on

          <hr>
          <strong>Monophysitism:</strong> Holds that Jesus had only one nature, which was either solely divine or a

          <hr>
          <strong>Pelagianism:</strong> Denies the doctrine of original sin and asserts that human beings could achieve

          <hr>
          <strong>Gnosticism:</strong> Holds that salvation comes through special knowledge and that the material

          <strong>Free Grace Theology:</strong> Group of theology that revolves around viewing salvation as a

    <h2>Other religions</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A7-17&version=mev"
        title="9 The great dragon was cast out, that ancient serpent called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.">Revelation
        12:7-17</a> tells us that satan got thrown down into earth and now hes trying to devour who he can with his lies
    </p>
    <p>Making sence of this logic, angels are all waiting in heaven and the demons and satan are ravaging on earth,
      there are a LOT less angels on earth than fallen angels/demons</p>
    <p>let us analyse some religions</p>
    <hr>
    <div class="religions">
      <center>
        <h3>Islam</h3>
        <p>Islam missleads people using main componnents like "jesus did not die on the cross" as in haddith <a
            href="https://quran.com/an-nisa/157">4:157</a></p>
        <p>So you have to ask yourself who paid for the sins of islamists, which can be found in the <a
            href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767d">sunnah muslim 2767d</a></p>
        <p>Also, islam affirms the bible in the <a href="https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=3">haddith 3:3</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Jehovas witness</h3>
        <p>Jehovas witnesses believe that Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit are 3 different gods</p>
        <p>The jehovas witnesses have a different version of the bible that has different texts in it than the normal
          bible<br>Thier version is the NWT (new world translation).</p>
        <p>Heres an example of a verse that has been changed:</p>
        <p>1 John 5:7:<br>7 For there are three witness bearers: 8 the spiritl and the waterm and the blood;n and the
          three are in agreement.</p>
        <p>In general the bible of the Jehovas witness has been corrupted</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Mormons</h3>
        <p>Mormons are very far away from what the bible teaches us</p>
        <p>Mormons have thier own book, its called "the book of mormons"</p>
        <p>Mormons have tons of gods and believe every man can be a god</p>
      </center>
    </div>
    <h2>Bookless religions</h2>
    <p>The booksless religion are usually always spiritual rules and opening yourself to the spiritual world</p>
    <p>as said, the world is full of demons, so youre opening yourself to demons to enter you and cause demon possesions
    </p>
    <p>Almost every spirit is a demon in this world</p>
